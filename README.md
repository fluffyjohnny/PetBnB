# PetBnB

## **PetBnB** is a user-friendly, single-page frontend AirBnB clone.

This project was done with the utilization of front-end languages including `NEXT.JS`, `HTML`, `CSS`, `REACT.JS`, along with libraries such as `date-fns`, `geolib`, `react-map-gl`, and `tailwind-scrollbar-hide`. 

PetBnB is a react page AirBnB clone that allows users to look housing rentals for their next vacation with their pet. The App diplays the available rentals in a specific area during selected dates. The purpose of this app is to help traveling owners bring their beloved pets along with them, supplying them with amenities and services that is more geared towards their pets. More functionalities are still being planned out and developed.
